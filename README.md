# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones

### Project Description
Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available [here](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf). For more information on this dataset have a look at [the Network of Thrones blog](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/).

### Project Tasks
1. Winter is Coming. Let's load the dataset ASAP!
2. Time for some Network of Thrones
3. Populate the network with the DataFrame
4. The most important character in Game of Thrones
5. The evolution of character importance
6. What's up with Stannis Baratheon?
7. What does Google PageRank tell us about GoT?
8. Correlation between different measures
9. Conclusion
